# Getting Started with R 🚩

In this document we'll have a walkthrough in R with definitions and practical examples.
We'll start from scratch, so if you're already know R and all its funcionalities this might not the most interesting place for you.

What we will cover here:

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Interfaces in R](#interfaces-in-r)
- [Data Management](#data-management)
- [Data Types in R](#data-types-in-r)
- [I/O in R](#i/o-in-r)
- [Basic Statistics](basic-statistics)
- [Basic Charts](basic-charts)



## 1. Prerequisites 🔻

Go to the website [http://r-project.org](http://r-project.org) where is hosted the official R project.
When I wrote this guide the latest version was <3.3.2 (Sincere Pumpkin Patch) has been released on Monday 2016-10-31.>.

Now go to "https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html" and click the closest mirror file you see and download an R version compatible with your

I do have OS so that's my file; http://cran.mirror.garr.it/mirrors/CRAN/bin/macosx/

Search your new R application (command line application)


## 2. Interfaces in R 🔻

#### GUI 🖱

RStudio is a free and OS IDE for R.

RStudio should already be up and running in your local machine if you had followed the first step. Now, what is RStudio?

#### Packages 📦

In R, packages are the the fundamental unit of shareable code.
A package group together compiled code, R functions, data, documentation, and tests, and is easy to share with others.

**C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork, or **CRAN**, is the public directory for R packages.
CRAN contains at the the moment +9800 packages and the directory it's massively growing dy-by-day.

To check how many packages are available on CRAN just write this command in your R console:
`nrow(available.packages())` and it will return the number of available packages.

Check out more here for [packages](https://github.com/leonardofed/og-r-web-analyst/blob/master/PACKAGES.md).

## 3. Data Management 🔻

#### How to create a variable:

To create variables use the assignment operator <-. The more standard "equal" operator would work in R too. It's just not recommended.

```
# Creating variables

# Saving a char in a varaible
firstName <- "John"  # char variable
str(firstName) # Check what's the data type

# Saving a num in a veraible
age <- 43  # num variable
str(age) # Check what's the data type

# Saving a vector in a veraible
a <- c(1,2,3,4,-5,6) # numeric vector
str(a)

# Saving a vector in a veraible
b<-matrix(1:5, nrow=5,ncol=5)
str(b)
```
<br />

#### Now learn how to rename a variable:

```
You can rename variables programmatically or interactively.
# Renaming Variables

data(cars) # Load cars dataset
cars # View cars table

install.packages("reshape")
library(reshape) #install this external package
cars <- rename(cars, c(dist="distance")) # Just renamed a variable in our data set
```
<br />

if (x < 0) {
  print("Negative num")
} else if (x > 0) {
  print("Positive num")
} else
  print("Zero")
```


 __for__

#Control Structures - FOR

```
for (val in sequence)
{
  statement
}

x <- c(2,5,3,9,8,11,6)
count <- 0
for (val in x) {
  if(val %% 2 == 0)  count = count+1
}
print(count)
```

__ifelse__

```
#Control Structures - IFELSE

ifelse(test_expression,x,y)

a = c(5,7,2,9)
ifelse(a %% 2 == 0,"even","odd")
```


#### Custom Functions ➰

```
myFunction<-function(n) #your function name
{
  if (n < 0) { # we'll use the if statement in our function
    print("Negative number")
  } else if (n > 0) {
    print("Positive number")
  } else
    print("Zero")
}

# now define a value
k<-10
# call your function
m <- myFunction(k)
```


#### Sorting Data 📏


To sort a data frame in R, use the order( ) function. By default, sorting is ASCENDING. Prepend the sorting variable by a minus sign to indicate DESCENDING order. Here are some examples.

#### Merging Data 🖇

Adding Columns
To merge two data frames use the merge function. To join to set of data you will need a a common variable that you will use as ID.

```c
# Merging files

# Load data
?longley
data(longley)

# Split up the data
x <- longley[1:14, 1:6]  # Starting data
y <- longley[1:14, 6:7]  # New column to add
z <- longley[15:16, ]     # New rows to add
write.table(x, "~/og-r-web-analyst/library/x.txt", sep="\t")
write.table(y, "~/og-r-web-analyst/library/y.txt", sep="\t")
write.table(z, "~/og-r-web-analyst/library/z.txt", sep="\t")

# Import data
xt <- read.table("~/og-r-web-analyst/library/x.txt", sep="\t")
yt <- read.table("~/og-r-web-analyst/library/y.txt", sep="\t")

# Take early years (a1t) and add columns (a2t)
# Must specify variable to match cases
x.y <- merge(xt, yt, by = "Year")  # Merge two data frames
x.y
```

See source file >>

#### Adding Rows ➕

To join two data frames (datasets) vertically, use the rbind function. The two data frames must have the same variables, but they do not have to be in the same order.

```
# Add two more cases at bottom
z <- read.table("~/og-r-web-analyst/library/z.txt", sep="\t")
all.data <- rbind(x.y, z)
row.names(all.data) <- NULL  # Reset row names
all.data  # Check data``
```
See source file >>


## 4. Data Types in R 🔻

#### Vectors 🔼

Lemme: what is a vector in R? Why do we use it? Why it's so important? How many type of vectors exist?

```
v <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
v
> [1] 1 2 3 4 5
```

```
a <- c(1,2,5.3,6,-2,4) # numeric vector
b <- c("one","two","three") # character vector
c <- c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE) #logical vector
```

Refer to elements of a vector using subscripts.

`a[c(2,4)] # 2nd and 4th elements of vector`


#### Matrices ⏹

All columns in a matrix must have the same mode(numeric, character, etc.) and the same length. The general format is

```
mymatrix <- matrix(vector, nrow=r, ncol=c, byrow=FALSE,
dimnames=list(char_vector_rownames, char_vector_colnames))
```


```
byrow=TRUE # Indicates that the matrix should be filled by rows.
byrow=FALSE # Indicates that the matrix should be filled by columns (the default).
dimnames # Provides optional labels for the columns and rows.
```

```
# generates 5 x 4 numeric matrix
y<-matrix(1:20, nrow=5,ncol=4)

# another example

cells <- c(1,26,24,68)
rnames <- c("R1", "R2")
cnames <- c("C1", "C2")
mymatrix <- matrix(cells, nrow=2, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE,
  dimnames=list(rnames, cnames))
```  



#### Data frames 🔣

Lemme: what is a data frame? Why do we use that? Why it's so important? How many type of vectors exist?

Technical info about Data Frames:
The top line of the table is called the `header`. Not so different from Excel?


**Input**

```
a = c(1, 2, 3)
b = c("mark", "Zoe", "Jack")
c = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
df = data.frame(a, b, c)        # df is a data frame
```

**Output**

```
a    b     c
1 1 mark  TRUE
2 2  Zoe FALSE
3 3 Jack  TRUE
```

You can test many different built-in data frames:

```
mtcars
               mpg cyl disp  hp drat   wt ...
Mazda RX4     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.62 ...
Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.88 ...
Datsun 710    22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.32 ...
```

The top line of the table, called the header, contains the column names. Each horizontal line afterward denotes a data row, which begins with the name of the row, and then
followed by the actual data. Each data member of a row is called a cell.

```
mtcars[1, 2]
[1] 6
```

Moreover, we can use the row and column names instead of the numeric coordinates.

```
mtcars["Mazda RX4", "cyl"]
[1] 6
```

Lastly, the number of data rows in the data frame is given by the nrow function.

```
nrow(mtcars)    # number of data rows
[1] 32
```

And the number of columns of a data frame is given by the ncol function.

```
ncol(mtcars)    # number of columns
[1] 11
```

Further details of the mtcars data set is available in the R documentation.

`help(mtcars)`

_(Preview)_

Instead of printing out the entire data frame, it is often desirable to preview it with the head function beforehand.

```
head(mtcars)
               mpg cyl disp  hp drat   wt ...
Mazda RX4     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.62 ...
```
<br />

#### Lists 🔢

An ordered collection of objects (components). A list allows you to gather a variety of (possibly unrelated) objects under one name.


```
#example of a list with 4 components -
# a string, a numeric vector, a matrix, and a scaler
w <- list(name="Fred", mynumbers=a, mymatrix=y, age=5.3)

# example of a list containing two lists

v <- c(list1,list2)
#Identify elements of a list using the [[]] convention.
mylist[[2]] # 2nd component of the list
mylist[["mynumbers"]] # component named mynumbers in list
```
<br />

#### Factors 🔤

Tell R that a variable is nominal by making it a factor. The factor stores the nominal values as a vector of integers in the range [ 1... k ] (where k is the number of unique values in the nominal variable), and an internal vector of character strings (the original values) mapped to these integers.

```
# variable gender with 20 "male" entries and
# 30 "female" entries

gender <- c(rep("male",20), rep("female", 30))
gender <- factor(gender)

# stores gender as 20 1s and 30 2s and associates
# 1=female, 2=male internally (alphabetically)
# R now treats gender as a nominal variable
```

``summary(gender)``

An ordered factor is used to represent an ordinal variable.


```
# variable rating coded as "large", "medium", "small'
> rating <- ordered(rating)

# recodes rating to 1,2,3 and associates
# 1=large, 2=medium, 3=small internally
# R now treats rating as ordinal
```

R will treat factors as nominal variables and ordered factors as ordinal variables in statistical proceedures and graphical analyses. You can use options in the factor( ) and ordered( ) functions to control the mapping of integers to strings (overiding the alphabetical ordering). You can also use factors to create value labels. For more on factors see the UCLA page.

```
### Useful Functions

 length(object) # number of elements or components
 str(object)    # structure of an object
 class(object)  # class or type of an object
 names(object)  # names

 c(object,object,...)       # combine objects into a vector
 cbind(object, object, ...) # combine objects as columns
 rbind(object, object, ...) # combine objects as rows

 object     # prints the object

 ls()       # list current objects
 rm(object) # delete an object

 newobject <- edit(object) # edit copy and save as newobject
 fix(object)               # edit in place
 ```

### Date Values

~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~


GOTCHAS

Data types and basic data table manipulations
 There are three important variable types: numeric, character and factor (a double variable with
a numeric and character value). You can query or assign types: is.factor() or as.factor().
 If you import a data table, variables that contain one or more character entries will be set to factor.
You can force them to numeric with this: as.numeric(as.character(dat1$VAR1))
 After subsetting or modification, you might want to refresh factor levels with droplevels(dat1)
 Data tables can be set as.data.frame(), as.matrix(), as.distance()
 names(dat1)=c("ID", "X", "Y", "Z") renames variables. Note that the length of the vector
must match the number of variable you have (four in this case).
 row.names(dat1)=dat1$ID. assigns an ID field to row names. Note that the default row names
are consecutive numbers. In order for this to work, each value in the ID field must be unique.
 To generate unique and descriptive row names that may serve as IDs, you can combine two or more
variables: row.names(dat1)=paste(dat1$SITE, dat1$PLOT, sep="-")
 If you only have numerical values in your data table, you can transpose it (switch rows and columns):
dat1_t=t(dat1). Row names become variables, so run the row.names() function above first.
 dat1[order(X),] orders rows by variable X. dat[order(X,Y),] orders rows by variable X, then
variable Y. dat1[order(X,-Y),]. Orders rows by variable X, then descending by variable Y.
 fix(dat1) to open the entire data table as a spreadsheet and edit cells with a double-click.

## I/O in R 🔁

Import, export, and quick checks
 dat1=read.csv("name.csv") to import a standard CSV file (first row are variable names).
 attach(dat1) to set a table as default to look for variables. Use detach() to release.
 dat1=read.delim("name.txt") to import a standard tab-delimited file.
 dat1=read.fwf("name.prn", widths=c(8,8,8)) fixed width (3 variables, 8 characters wide).
 ?read.table to find out more options for importing non-standard data files.
 dat1=read.dbf("name.dbf") requires installation of the foreign package to import DBF files.
 head(dat1) to check the first few rows and variable names of the data table you imported.
 names(dat1) to list variable names in quotation marks (handy for copy and paste to code).
 data.frame(names(dat1)) gives you a list of your variables with the column number indicated,
which can be handy for sub-setting a data table (see next page)
 nrow(dat1) and ncol(dat1) returns the number of rows and columns of a data table.
 length(dat1$VAR1[!is.na(dat1$VAR1)] returns a count of non-missing values in a variable.
 str(dat1) to check variable types, which is useful to see if the import executed correctly.
 write.csv(results, "myresults.csv", na="", row.names=F) to export data. Without
the option statements, missing values will be represented by NA and row numbers will be written out.

- Import a CSV

# first row contains variable names, comma is separator
# assign the variable id to row names
# note the / instead of \ on mswindows systems

``mydata <- read.table("c:/mydata.csv", header=TRUE,
  	sep=",", row.names="id")``

- Import From Excel

From Excel
One of the best ways to read an Excel file is to export it to a comma delimited file and import it using the method above. Alternatively you can use the xlsx package to access Excel files. The first row should contain variable/column names.

``# read in the first worksheet from the workbook myexcel.xlsx
# first row contains variable names
library(xlsx)
mydata <- read.xlsx("c:/myexcel.xlsx", 1)
# read in the worksheet named mysheet
mydata <- read.xlsx("c:/myexcel.xlsx", sheetName = "mysheet")``

- Import from Google Cloud BigQuery

- Export to CSV

- Export to PDF

- Getting Information on a Dataset


## Statistics 📊

- Descriptive Statistics

  1. Packages
  2. Sampels

  R provides a wide range of functions for obtaining summary statistics. One method of obtaining descriptive statistics is to use the sapply( ) function with a specified summary statistic.

  ``> # get means for variables in data frame mydata
  > # excluding missing values
  > sapply(mydata, mean, na.rm=TRUE)``

Possible functions used in sapply include mean, sd, var, min, max, median, range, and quantile.
There are also numerous R functions designed to provide a range of descriptive statistics at once. For example

``# mean,median,25th and 75th quartiles,min,max
  summary(mydata)``

``# Tukey min,lower-hinge, median,upper-hinge,max
  fivenum(x)``
