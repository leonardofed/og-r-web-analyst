# Getting Started with R 🚩

In this document we'll have a walkthrough in R with definitions and practical examples.
We'll start from scratch, so if you're already know R and all its funcionalities this might not the most interesting place for you.

What we will cover here:

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Interfaces in R](#interfaces-in-r)
- [Data Management](#data-management)
- [Data Types in R](#data-types-in-r)
- [I/O in R](#i/o-in-r)
- [Basic Statistics](basic-statistics)
- [Basic Charts](basic-charts)



## 1. Prerequisites 🔻

Go to the website [http://r-project.org](http://r-project.org) where is hosted the official R project.
When I wrote this guide the latest version was <3.3.2 (Sincere Pumpkin Patch) has been released on Monday 2016-10-31.>.

Now go to "https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html" and click the closest mirror file you see and download an R version compatible with your

I do have OS so that's my file; http://cran.mirror.garr.it/mirrors/CRAN/bin/macosx/

Search your new R application (command line application)


## 2. Interfaces in R 🔻

#### GUI 🖱

RStudio is a free and OS IDE for R.

RStudio should already be up and running in your local machine if you had followed the first step. Now, what is RStudio?

#### Packages 📦

In R, packages are the the fundamental unit of shareable code.
A package group together compiled code, R functions, data, documentation, and tests, and is easy to share with others.

**C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork, or **CRAN**, is the public directory for R packages.
CRAN contains at the the moment +9800 packages and the directory it's massively growing dy-by-day.

To check how many packages are available on CRAN just write this command in your R console:
`nrow(available.packages())` and it will return the number of available packages.

Check out more here for [packages](https://github.com/leonardofed/og-r-web-analyst/blob/master/PACKAGES.md).

## 3. Data Management 🔻

#### How to create a variable:

To create variables use the assignment operator <-. The more standard "equal" operator would work in R too. It's just not recommended.

```
# Creating variables

# Saving a char in a varaible
firstName <- "John"  # char variable
str(firstName) # Check what's the data type

# Saving a num in a veraible
age <- 43  # num variable
str(age) # Check what's the data type

# Saving a vector in a veraible
a <- c(1,2,3,4,-5,6) # numeric vector
str(a)

# Saving a vector in a veraible
b<-matrix(1:5, nrow=5,ncol=5)
str(b)
```
<br />

#### Now learn how to rename a variable:

```
You can rename variables programmatically or interactively.
# Renaming Variables

data(cars) # Load cars dataset
cars # View cars table

install.packages("reshape")
library(reshape) #install this external package
cars <- rename(cars, c(dist="distance")) # Just renamed a variable in our data set
```
<br />

__if-else__

```
# Simple if else if statement
x <- 0
if (x < 0) {
  print("Negative num")
} else if (x > 0) {
  print("Positive num")
} else
  print("Zero")
```


 __for__

#Control Structures - FOR

```
for (val in sequence)
{
  statement
}

x <- c(2,5,3,9,8,11,6)
count <- 0
for (val in x) {
  if(val %% 2 == 0)  count = count+1
}
print(count)
```


__while__

```
#Control Structures - WHILE

while (test_expression)
{
  statement
}

i <- 1

while (i < 6) {
  print(i)
  i = i+1
}
```

__switch__

``switch(expr, ...)``

__ifelse__

```
#Control Structures - IFELSE

ifelse(test_expression,x,y)

a = c(5,7,2,9)
ifelse(a %% 2 == 0,"even","odd")
```


#### Custom Functions ➰

```
myFunction<-function(n) #your function name
{
  if (n < 0) { # we'll use the if statement in our function
    print("Negative number")
  } else if (n > 0) {
    print("Positive number")
  } else
    print("Zero")
}

# now define a value
k<-10
# call your function
m <- myFunction(k)
```


#### Sorting Data 📏


To sort a data frame in R, use the order( ) function. By default, sorting is ASCENDING. Prepend the sorting variable by a minus sign to indicate DESCENDING order. Here are some examples.

#### Merging Data 🖇

Adding Columns
To merge two data frames use the merge function. To join to set of data you will need a a common variable that you will use as ID.

```c
# Merging files

# Load data
?longley
data(longley)

# Split up the data
x <- longley[1:14, 1:6]  # Starting data
y <- longley[1:14, 6:7]  # New column to add
z <- longley[15:16, ]     # New rows to add
write.table(x, "~/og-r-web-analyst/library/x.txt", sep="\t")
write.table(y, "~/og-r-web-analyst/library/y.txt", sep="\t")
write.table(z, "~/og-r-web-analyst/library/z.txt", sep="\t")

# Import data
xt <- read.table("~/og-r-web-analyst/library/x.txt", sep="\t")
yt <- read.table("~/og-r-web-analyst/library/y.txt", sep="\t")

# Take early years (a1t) and add columns (a2t)
# Must specify variable to match cases
x.y <- merge(xt, yt, by = "Year")  # Merge two data frames
x.y
```

See source file >>

#### Adding Rows ➕

To join two data frames (datasets) vertically, use the rbind function. The two data frames must have the same variables, but they do not have to be in the same order.

```
# Add two more cases at bottom
z <- read.table("~/og-r-web-analyst/library/z.txt", sep="\t")
all.data <- rbind(x.y, z)
row.names(all.data) <- NULL  # Reset row names
all.data  # Check data``
```
See source file >>


## 4. Data Types in R 🔻

#### Vectors 🔼

Lemme: what is a vector in R? Why do we use it? Why it's so important? How many type of vectors exist?

```
v <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
v
> [1] 1 2 3 4 5
```

```
a <- c(1,2,5.3,6,-2,4) # numeric vector
b <- c("one","two","three") # character vector
c <- c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE) #logical vector
```

Refer to elements of a vector using subscripts.

`a[c(2,4)] # 2nd and 4th elements of vector`


#### Matrices ⏹

All columns in a matrix must have the same mode(numeric, character, etc.) and the same length. The general format is

```
mymatrix <- matrix(vector, nrow=r, ncol=c, byrow=FALSE,
dimnames=list(char_vector_rownames, char_vector_colnames))
```


```
byrow=TRUE # Indicates that the matrix should be filled by rows.
byrow=FALSE # Indicates that the matrix should be filled by columns (the default).
dimnames # Provides optional labels for the columns and rows.
```

```
# generates 5 x 4 numeric matrix
y<-matrix(1:20, nrow=5,ncol=4)

# another example

cells <- c(1,26,24,68)
rnames <- c("R1", "R2")
cnames <- c("C1", "C2")
mymatrix <- matrix(cells, nrow=2, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE,
  dimnames=list(rnames, cnames))
```  



#### Data frames 🔣

Lemme: what is a data frame? Why do we use that? Why it's so important? How many type of vectors exist?

Technical info about Data Frames:
The top line of the table is called the `header`. Not so different from Excel?


**Input**

```
a = c(1, 2, 3)
b = c("mark", "Zoe", "Jack")
c = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
df = data.frame(a, b, c)        # df is a data frame
```

**Output**

```
a    b     c
1 1 mark  TRUE
2 2  Zoe FALSE
3 3 Jack  TRUE
```

You can test many different built-in data frames:

```
mtcars
               mpg cyl disp  hp drat   wt ...
Mazda RX4     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.62 ...
Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.88 ...
Datsun 710    22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.32 ...
```

The top line of the table, called the header, contains the column names. Each horizontal line afterward denotes a data row, which begins with the name of the row, and then
followed by the actual data. Each data member of a row is called a cell.

```
mtcars[1, 2]
[1] 6
```

Moreover, we can use the row and column names instead of the numeric coordinates.

```
mtcars["Mazda RX4", "cyl"]
[1] 6
```

Lastly, the number of data rows in the data frame is given by the nrow function.

```
nrow(mtcars)    # number of data rows
[1] 32
```

And the number of columns of a data frame is given by the ncol function.

```
ncol(mtcars)    # number of columns
[1] 11
```

Further details of the mtcars data set is available in the R documentation.

`help(mtcars)`

_(Preview)_

Instead of printing out the entire data frame, it is often desirable to preview it with the head function beforehand.

```
head(mtcars)
               mpg cyl disp  hp drat   wt ...
Mazda RX4     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.62 ...
```
<br />

#### Lists 🔢

An ordered collection of objects (components). A list allows you to gather a variety of (possibly unrelated) objects under one name.


```
#example of a list with 4 components -
# a string, a numeric vector, a matrix, and a scaler
w <- list(name="Fred", mynumbers=a, mymatrix=y, age=5.3)

# example of a list containing two lists

v <- c(list1,list2)
#Identify elements of a list using the [[]] convention.
mylist[[2]] # 2nd component of the list
mylist[["mynumbers"]] # component named mynumbers in list
```
<br />

#### Factors 🔤

Tell R that a variable is nominal by making it a factor. The factor stores the nominal values as a vector of integers in the range [ 1... k ] (where k is the number of unique values in the nominal variable), and an internal vector of character strings (the original values) mapped to these integers.

```
# variable gender with 20 "male" entries and
# 30 "female" entries

gender <- c(rep("male",20), rep("female", 30))
gender <- factor(gender)

# stores gender as 20 1s and 30 2s and associates
# 1=female, 2=male internally (alphabetically)
# R now treats gender as a nominal variable
```

``summary(gender)``

An ordered factor is used to represent an ordinal variable.


```
# variable rating coded as "large", "medium", "small'
> rating <- ordered(rating)

# recodes rating to 1,2,3 and associates
# 1=large, 2=medium, 3=small internally
# R now treats rating as ordinal
```

R will treat factors as nominal variables and ordered factors as ordinal variables in statistical proceedures and graphical analyses. You can use options in the factor( ) and ordered( ) functions to control the mapping of integers to strings (overiding the alphabetical ordering). You can also use factors to create value labels. For more on factors see the UCLA page.

```
### Useful Functions

 length(object) # number of elements or components
 str(object)    # structure of an object
 class(object)  # class or type of an object
 names(object)  # names

 c(object,object,...)       # combine objects into a vector
 cbind(object, object, ...) # combine objects as columns
 rbind(object, object, ...) # combine objects as rows

 object     # prints the object

 ls()       # list current objects
 rm(object) # delete an object

 newobject <- edit(object) # edit copy and save as newobject
 fix(object)               # edit in place
 ```
