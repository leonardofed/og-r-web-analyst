# Packages in R

##### What are Packages in R? ðŸ’¾

In R, packages are the the fundamental unit of shareable code.
A package group together compiled code, R functions, data, documentation, and tests, and is easy to share with others.

__C__omprehensive __R__ __A__rchive __N__etwork, or __CRAN__, is the public directory for R packages.
CRAN contains at the the moment +9800 packages and the directory it's massively growing dy-by-day.

To check how many packages are available on CRAN just write this command in your R console:
`nrow(available.packages())` and it will return the number of available packages.

##### Common operations with Packages ðŸ“Š

You install them from CRAN with `install.packages("myPackage")`.
You use them in your R project with `library("x")` OR `require("myPackage")`.
You get immediate help with `?myPackage` and `help(package = "myPackage")`.
